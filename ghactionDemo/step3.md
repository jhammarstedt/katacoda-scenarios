# Running the GitHub Action

We will now test the GitHub action by making a push request to our remote GitHub repository. Make a trivial change to one of the files in the repository(such as adding a space in the README). Then push the change to the remote repository by running the following commands in the terminal: 

```   
git add .
git commit -m 'Made trivial change to the code'
git push
```   

We will then go to our remote repo at`https://github.com/INSERT_GITHUB_USERNAME/Benchmark_Tutorial `using our preferred web browser( Note: Insert your GitHub username into the url).
