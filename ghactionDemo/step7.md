# Handling the data and display it with Github Pages
Now we have an output.json file ready to be displayed. But there are still a couple of issues here. The output file will be overwritten every time and we don't really have a way to display the history and compare the results. One could solve this in multiple ways by simply saving data from the output file in another file, but we will utulize github pages to display some selected statistics in a table. 

## Setting up github pages
Go to settings on Github and press Pages. Under source select master and then press save
Just like that you have a page!
<img src="https://github.com/jhammarstedt/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/ghactionDemo/images/pages_intro1.PNG?raw=true" />

Your page should now be published on `https://INSERT_USERNAME.github.io/Benchmark_Tutorial/`

If nothing is specified the page will display your README.md file. In our case we want it to run the `index.html` file in `docs/`. 
* So change the source from root to docs as shown in the image. 

Github pages will either by default read a index.md or index.html, which fortunate for you, is already in there (both the index file and the css file were just taken from this [template website](https://uicookies.com/css-table-templates/)). You can press the link and try to run it. It might be a little slow to update so if it dosen't work wait a little and refresh the page.

Examining the flowchart again:

We haven't adressed the `format_output` file yet. For simplicity we will just write a python script that reads the `output.json` and edits the `index.html` by adding the new table values. For the `index.html` file we choose the include Commit, Date, Mean, Max, Min, Standard Deviation (All in ms). (The file could look odd but you can format it by right clicking and press `Format Document` while watching the file in the IDE)

Now let's create the python script.

`touch src/generate_output.py`{{execute}}

Then we insert the following code (this tutorial won't cover [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) but it's a good package to handle html files in):

``` 
import json
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import os

"""
This file will read the latest output file generated by the workflow and take out relevant statistics.
As this tutorial is more to show of the workflow and how to set up a github action than building websites,
we'll be simply inserting the new data in the index.html file instead of having a js file that would read the json file.
which requires some more integration.
"""

with open("output.json","r") as f: 
    data = json.load(f)

# First we get the new data statistics as a markdown to the index file
commit = data["commit_info"]["id"]
date = data["commit_info"]["time"]
mean = data["benchmarks"][0]["stats"]["mean"]
mini = data["benchmarks"][0]["stats"]["mean"]
maxi = data["benchmarks"][0]["stats"]["max"]
std = data["benchmarks"][0]["stats"]["stddev"]

# The format of the index.html is to place new entires in <tr> = <tablerow> which will be inside a tableBody
new_data = f"""<tr>
                <td>{commit} </td>
                <td>{date}</td>
                <td>{mean}</td>
                <td>{maxi}</td>
                <td>{mini}</td>
                <td>{std}</td>
            </tr>"""

# Using bs4 we can now just insert the new data to the table, maybe not best practice but it works :)
html = open('docs/index.html')
soup = BeautifulSoup(html,'html.parser')
soup.tbody.tr.append(BeautifulSoup( new_data,'html.parser'))
html.close()

new_html = soup.prettify(soup.original_encoding)
with open("docs/index.html",'w') as f:
      f.write(new_html)
      f.close()
```{{copy}}



The 'data/generate_output.py' script reads the json with the new data and inserts the specified values into the index.html so it can be displayed on our page.

We have to add the benchmarking and formatting scripts to our GitHub action. Open the '.github/workflows/python.yml' file using a text editor and insert the following code below the last line:

```
python src/generate_output.py
```{{copy}}

This code will run the pytest benchmarking tool on the 'benchmarking.py' script and the results will be stored in the 'output.json' file. The 'src/generate_output.py' will then format the results stored in 'output.json' and store it in the 'index.html' file.
